The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:
•	Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

The variables included in this dataset are:
•	steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA )
•	date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
•	interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

Commit containing full submission
1.	Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
2.	Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
3.	Mean and median number of steps taken each day
4.	Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
5.	The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
6.	Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
7.	Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
8.	Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
